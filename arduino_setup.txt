# Arduino Setup Instructions for Face Recognition System

This guide provides detailed steps to set up the Arduino hardware and software for the face recognition system on a Windows PC.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- USB cable (USB-A to USB-B for Uno)
- 16x2 I2C LCD display (address 0x27)
- LED with 220Ω resistor
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional)

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Install Arduino IDE

- Download the Arduino IDE from https://www.arduino.cc/en/software.
- Run the installer and follow the prompts to install.
- Open the Arduino IDE to verify it works.

### 2. Connect the Arduino

- Connect the Arduino to your Windows PC using the USB cable.
- Windows should install drivers automatically. If not, download drivers from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Windows.
- Open Device Manager (Win + X, then "Device Manager").
- Under "Ports (COM & LPT)", note the COM port (e.g., COM3).
- Update the ARDUINO_PORT variable in face_recog_mobile.py to match (e.g., ARDUINO_PORT = "COM3").

### 3. Wire the Components

- **LCD Wiring** (16x2 I2C LCD):
  - VCC: Connect to Arduino 5V
  - GND: Connect to Arduino GND
  - SDA: Connect to Arduino A4
  - SCL: Connect to Arduino A5
- **LED Wiring**:
  - LED anode: Connect to Arduino pin 8 via a 220Ω resistor
  - LED cathode: Connect to Arduino GND
- Use a breadboard for easier connections if needed.

### 4. Install Arduino Libraries

- Open Arduino IDE.
- Go to Sketch &gt; Include Library &gt; Manage Libraries.
- Search for "LiquidCrystal I2C" by Frank de Brabander and install it.
- The Wire library is included by default.

### 5. Upload the Arduino Code

- Open face_recog_mobile_Arduino.txt in a text editor.
- Copy the code and paste it into a new Arduino sketch (File &gt; New in Arduino IDE).
- Save the sketch as face_recog_mobile_Arduino.ino.
- Select your board: Tools &gt; Board &gt; Arduino Uno (or your board model).
- Select the COM port: Tools &gt; Port &gt; COM3 (replace with your port).
- Click the Upload button (right arrow) to upload the code.
- The LCD should display "Waiting for data" after uploading.

### 6. Test the Arduino

- Ensure the Python script is running with the virtual environment activated:

  ```
  cd C:\Users\<YourUsername>\face_recognition_project
  venv\Scripts\activate
  python face_recog_mobile.py
  ```
- Select option 2 (Verify faces) to test communication.
- The LCD should show:
  - "Waiting for data" when no face is detected.
  - "Unknown/No Match" for unrecognized faces.
  - "Face Matched!" with username and status (Entry/Exit) for recognized faces.
- The LED should light up when a face is matched.

## Troubleshooting

- **Serial Port Issues**:
  - Verify the COM port in Device Manager.
  - Run the following in Python to list ports:

    ```
    python -c "import serial.tools.list_ports; print([port.device for port in serial.tools.list_ports.comports()])"
    ```
  - Ensure no other program (e.g., Arduino IDE Serial Monitor) is using the port.
- **LCD Not Displaying**:
  - Check wiring connections.
  - Verify the I2C address (0x27). Use an I2C scanner sketch if needed.
- **LED Not Working**:
  - Ensure the LED is connected to pin 8 with a resistor.
  - Test the LED with a simple Arduino sketch to confirm it works.

## Notes

- Keep the Arduino connected to the PC during operation, as the Python script communicates via serial.
- Ensure the Python script uses the correct COM port to avoid connection errors.
- Close the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor before running the Python script to free the COM port.
